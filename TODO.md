- UI for managing temp saved data and visualizing/loading from file data. Use mobile-friendly capacitor libraries or something so we can leverage built in mobile UI as much as possible.

    - login system?
- Reimplement spectrometer UI, CSVs, and bounding box creator but as a layer as we're doing both regular images and spectrograms.
- BrowserFS useful?

- image/video blocks in the temp or file section, then click to predict them, for videos we'll process frame by frame unless it does video input
