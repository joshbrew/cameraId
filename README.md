Copy of the official wonnx squeeze net test with a test for multithreading the video codec so I can store recent data in memory and draw image copies to canvases or send to the classifier or do other things. 

It uses the capacitor community CameraPreview API for mobile camera access but the rest is vanilla JS, though the mobile app isn't set up yet with the special permissions and build step requirements. This repo will evolve.

# build and run
`npm i -g tinybuild` then `npm start`
